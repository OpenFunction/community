# OpenFunction Community

Welcome to the OpenFunction community. This is the starting point for becoming a contributor, improving the code and docs, giving presentations and all the goodness of helping out on the project. We are a friendly, collaborative group and look forward to working together.

## Introduction

[OpenFunction](https://openfunction.dev/) is a cloud-native open source FaaS (Function as a Service) platform aiming to let you focus on your business logic without having to maintain the underlying runtime environment and infrastructure. You only need to submit business-related source code in the form of functions.

## Communication

We want your contributions and suggestions! One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions, chat on IM or join the bi-weekly community calls.

### Questions and issues

OpenFunction is sponsored and open-sourced by the [KubeSphere](http://kubesphere.io/) Team and maintained by the OpenFunction community. Reach out with any questions you may have and we'll make sure to answer them as soon as possible and as a community member feel free to jump in and answer questions.
